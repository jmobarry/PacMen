# PacMen

Title: Pacmen Exercise

Description: This exercise creates numerous PacMen and initializes them in random position and velocities. The javascript file keeps track of the velocity and positions of the PacMen in relation to the container and rebounds the pacmen in the opposite direction if they collide with the border of the container.

How to run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/PacMen/ click "Add PacMan" to add as many PacMen as desired and press "Start Game" to put the Pacmen in motion.

Roadmap: In the future I would like to add the featue to this project where Pacmen that collide with eachother also rebound in the opposite direction.
